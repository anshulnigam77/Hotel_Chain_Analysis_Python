# Hotel Chain Business Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel chain business. The analysis involves importing data from multiple CSV files, cleaning and transforming the data, and generating insights to understand key business metrics such as occupancy percentage and revenue realized.

## Data Sources

The project uses the following CSV files:

1. `bookings.csv` - Contains information about individual bookings.
2. `aggregate_bookings.csv` - Provides aggregated booking data.
3. `hotels.csv` - Contains details about the hotels in the chain.
4. `date.csv` - Includes date-related information.
5. `room.csv` - Provides details about the rooms in the hotels.

## Objectives

1. **Data Import**: Load data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and content of the data.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
4. **Data Transformation**: Prepare data for analysis through feature creation, dataset merging, and aggregation.
5. **Insight Generation**: Analyze data to understand key business metrics like occupancy percentage and revenue realized.

## Key Metrics

- **Occupancy Percentage**: Measures the percentage of rooms that are occupied over a period.
- **Revenue Realized**: Calculates the total revenue generated from bookings.

## Skills and Techniques

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Merge**: Combining multiple DataFrames.
  - **Concat**: Concatenating DataFrames.
  - **GroupBy**: Aggregating data to generate insights.
- **Matplotlib**: Creating visualizations such as bar charts.
- **Calculated Columns**: Creating new columns based on existing data.
